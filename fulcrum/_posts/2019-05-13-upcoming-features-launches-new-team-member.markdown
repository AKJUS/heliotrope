## Feature Development
<img class="responsive-img" alt="A diagram of the development roadmap for the remainder of the year" src="/img/blog/2019-05-13-upcoming-features-launches-new-team-member-1.png" />

Our development team has been working hard to implement a few new features, including [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/), an open-source annotation tool. This tool will launch with the forthcoming Lever Press title *History of Chronology* by Stefan Tanaka in the next few weeks. We are working to update our website to include a more detailed development roadmap, so stay tuned!

## National Museum of Japanese History (Rekihaku)
In late March 2019, we published an open access essay collection from the National Museum of Japanese History (or popularly known as Rekihaku in Japan) titled Integrated Studies of Cultural and Research Resources. The ISCRR project approaches Japanese historical resources from the perspective of interdisciplinary studies in the humanities and sciences using information infrastructure. Be sure to [check it out on Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.org/rekihaku)!

## ACLS HEB Oplontis Volume 2
We are working hard on the upcoming release of *Oplontis Villa A (“of Poppaea”) at Torre Annunziata, Italy, Volume 2: The Decorations, Stucco, Pavements, Sculptures*, edited by John R. Clarke and Nayla K. Muntasser. This is the second of four volumes devoted to the archaeological discoveries made at the Villa A site at Oplontis (Torre Annunziata, Italy). These titles are open-access and exclusively offered in the ACLS Humanities E-Book collection on Fulcrum. You can view the first volume on [Fulcrum](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.90048.0001.001). 

## A New Team Member
We are excited to welcome Matt Naglak to the Fulcrum team! Matt will be working as the [Rackham Graduate Public Engagement Fellow](https://rackham.umich.edu/professional-development/program-in-public-scholarship/rackham-public-engagement-fellowships/) from May - August 2019. His work will focus on market research to understand the needs, constraints, and wishes of the authors and readers who will use this platform, and the libraries and publishers that are adopting it as well as collaboration with the development team to inform the development of features such as geospatial mapping/data and usage/impact reporting.

In April, a few team members travelled to Cleveland to represent Fulcrum and the UMP EBC at ACRL. The University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection, which launched in January 2019, is available on Fulcrum, where you can [check out sample open access titles](https://fulcrum.org/michigan).
