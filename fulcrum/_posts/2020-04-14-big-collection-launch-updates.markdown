## What We've Been Up To
BAR Publishing Launch 
We're excited to announce that our latest (and now, the second largest) collection of ebooks is live on Fulcrum. BAR Publishing (publisher of British Archaeological Reports), a mission-driven specialist publisher in archaeological research located in Oxford, has launched the first-ever digital version of their extensive frontlist and backlist, going back over 40 years and encompassing nearly 3,000 titles (with hundreds more yet to come). The collection is for sale to libraries, and available here: [https://www.fulcrum.org/barpublishing](https://www.fulcrum.org/barpublishing).

## Mellon Foundation Grant Announcement
We are pleased to announce Michigan Publishing has received $750,000 in support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to re-envision the American Council of Learned Societies Humanities E-Book Collection (ACLS HEB) on Fulcrum. The Foundation’s generous investment will strengthen Fulcrum’s capacity to support large collections of ebooks. The focus will be on developing new ways to explore the corpus, richer usage reporting, and interoperability with other tools and platforms. The two-year grant also supports a program of research and engagement aimed at enriching ACLS HEB’s value to publishers, learned societies, and libraries.
