## Free-to-Read UMP EBC
University of Michigan Press has [extended free-to-read access](https://blog.press.umich.edu/2020/06/university-of-michigan-press-extends-free-to-read-ebook-access-announces-flat-pricing-for-2021-and-requests-library-investment/) to [UMP EBC](http://www.fulcrum.org/michigan) until the end of August 2020, strengthening its support of students, librarians, and faculty who need ebook access as they continue to transition to online learning and teaching.
