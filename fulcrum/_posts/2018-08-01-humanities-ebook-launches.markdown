Weâ€™re excited to announce that ACLS Humanities E-Book (HEB) is now live on Fulcrum! HEB is an online collection of 5,400+ scholarly titles in the humanities offered through a longstanding partnership between the American Council of Learned Societies and Michigan Publishing. Launched in 2002 as the ACLS History E-Book Project, HEB now covers over forty subject areas, has over 800 global subscribers, and works with over 100 scholarly publishers worldwide.

## New Features for Humanities E-Book users
Fulcrum provides HEB users a new web-native reading experience that is accessible and compatible with mobile devices. Users at institutions with subscription access to this collection will be able to navigate and interact with HEB titles more easily than ever before. A few major changes HEB readers will notice include:

- A newly designed, browsable **catalog page** that presents readers with a much more visually compelling and easily navigable experience.

- An enriched reading experience in our **new e-reader** that includes features like pageturner and scroll views, an always-present table of contents, and citation and search widgets. The reader also provides improved accessibility features, aimed at meeting the stringent WCAG 2.0 AA standards.

- An enhanced **e-book home page** that provides quick access to the table of contents, reviews, metadata, and statistics, as well as easy access to the e-reader and chapter downloads.
