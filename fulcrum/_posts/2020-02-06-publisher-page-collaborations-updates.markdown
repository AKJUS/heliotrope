## Art History Publication Initiative Partnership 
In March, we'll be launching a partnership with the Art History Publication Initiative (AHPI), a Mellon-funded project supported by the University of Washington Press, University of Pennsylvania Press, Duke University Press, and Penn State University Press. The collection will include 54 monographs with high-resolution images and videos and a PDF catalog, all hosted on Fulcrum. Learn more about the AHPI at [their website](https://arthistorypi.org/).  

## Visualizing Impact and Engagement

We've recently added a Readership Map and Google Analytics Data Studio Report to the [UMP EBC](https://fulcrum.org/michigan) and the [ACLS HEB](https://fulcrum.org/heb) collections. The live readership map reflects every view or download of book or media component that occurred the previous day. The pins also include the title and user location. The Google Analytics tab includes a Data Studio report that displays the sources driving engagement, user location, and books with the most page views.

## New Web Pages for Lever Press
We recently developed and launched publisher "aboutware," or web pages for Fulcrum publishers, that provide additional information about the publisher and its books. The first Fulcrum publisher to utilize this new feature is Lever Press. We will be making aboutware available to other hosted collections and publishers soon. Check out the new Lever Press website at [https://www.leverpress.org](https://www.leverpress.org).

## Collaboration with UNC Press
Forthcoming this March is an open access ebook by Nicole Myers Turner titled Soul Liberty: The Evolution of Black Religious Politics in Postemancipation Virginia. We are excited to collaborate with UNC Press on this title, which will launch with new GIS mapping features. Read more on the [UNC Press website](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469655239/soul-liberty/).

## New Home for ACLS HEB
Michigan Publishing is the new organizational home for the ACLS Humanities E-Book Collection. In 2019, ACLS transferred the ownership of the collection to Michigan Publishing, its long-time partner, taking effect in 2020. Since 2005, Michigan Publishing has hosted and distributed the collection, most recently successfully migrating it to [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.org/heb). Michigan Publishing has committed to maintaining the practices and the mission of ACLS HEB and will continue to partner with ACLS, which will continue to oversee the selection of titles.
