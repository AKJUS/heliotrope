<h2>Partnership Models</h2>
<p>We offer three partnership models to meet the individual needs of our clients. For more information, please email fulcrum-info@umich.edu.</p>

<div class="model">
  <h3>Single Title Hosting</h3>
  <p>This partnership model is offered to publishers looking for an Open Access publication solution for individual media-rich books. Rather than hosting the supplemental materials associated with a book on a web platform like WordPress not built for books, this model gives partners access to the features of the Fulcrum platform, including long-term preservation and integration into the information supply chain, without a long-term financial commitment.</p>
  <p>Current single title partners on Fulcrum include Northwestern University Press and NYU Press.</p>
</div>

<div class="model">
  <h3>Hosted Publisher</h3>
  <p>This partnership model is offered to publishers looking to host all of their Open Access books on Fulcrum. Structured with an annual fee, the Hosted Publisher model allows partners to have as many titles on Fulcrum as they wish. Hosted Publishers also have access to an a la carte suite of publishing services [anchor link to services below] that can bring projects from the manuscript stage all the way to final online and print publication.</p>
  <p>Current hosted publishers on Fulcrum include Lever Press.</p>
</div>

<div class="model">
  <h3>Hosted Collection</h3>
  <p>This partnership model is offered to publishers looking to host a larger collection of titles for sale to libraries or other customers. We create a branded digital presence powered by Fulcrum. Titles and any associated supplemental materials are packaged together as a collection, including rich metadata, a catalog page, search functionality, and the Fulcrum Reader. This partnership model also offers access to a suite of value-added publishing services [anchor link to services below].</p>

  <p>Current hosted collections on Fulcrum include ACLS Humanities E-Book and the University of Michigan Press.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fulcrum Services</h2>
