          <h3>A Mid-Republican House from Gabii</h3>
          <span class="author">Rachel Opitz, Marcello Mogetta, and Nicola Terrenato, Editors</span>
          <span class="pubdate">University of Michigan Press, 2016</span>
	      <p class="light">Since 2009 the Gabii Project, an international archaeological initiative led by Nicola Terrenato and the University of Michigan, has been investigating the ancient Latin town of Gabii, which was both a neighbor of, and a rival to, Rome in the first millennium BCE. The trajectory of Gabii, from an Iron Age settlement to a flourishing mid-Republican town to an Imperial agglomeration widely thought to be in decline, provides a new perspective on the dynamics of settlement in central Italy. <em>A Mid-Republican House from Gabii</em> focuses on the construction, inhabitation, and repurposing of a private home at Gabii, built in the mid-Republican period. Published in digital form as a website backed up by a detailed database, the publication provides a synthesis of excavation results linked to the relevant spatial, descriptive, and quantitative data. Fulcrum brings together the database, narrative, and interactive 3D model of the reconstructed ancient site to give the user a seamless reading experience, presenting the narrative and 3D model side by side and including comprehensive linking throughout all components enabling the reader to move through the project in a number of ways.

          <span class="pubdate">NYU Press, 2017</span>
          <p class="light"><em>Show Sold Separately</em> gives critical attention to the ubiquitous but often overlooked phenomenon of audiences approaching movies and TV shows with preconceived notions about them, shaped by the onslaught of information and hype that surround them. This book examines a wide range of materials from DVD bonus materials to action figures that reveal the world of film and television that exists before and after the show. New York University Press used Fulcrum to host the book’s impressive array of video clips and images that are embedded in the EPUB, which is available for reading in the <a href="http://openaccessbooks.nyupress.org/details/9780814731956/">New York University Press Open Access Books portal</a>. The videos are presented using AblePlayer, a fully-accessible cross-browser media player. Users are able to pan and zoom the images from within the e-reader, using the Leaflet viewer. Users are able to enjoy these media assets from the comfort of the e-reader environment, providing them an integrated, seamless reading experience.</p>

          <span class="pubdate">Northwestern University Press, 2016</span>
          <p class="light"><em>The Director's Prism</em> investigates how and why three of Russia's most innovative directors— Vsevolod Meyerhold, Alexander Tairov, and Sergei Eisenstein—used the fantastical tales of German Romantic writer E. T. A. Hoffmann to reinvent the rules of theatrical practice. Fulcrum allowed Northwestern University Press to publish video clips of theatrical productions, an audio file, and additional full color images that can be viewed in more detail with Fulcrum's image viewer.</p>

          <p class="light"><em>Canoes: A Natural History</em> explores the cultural history of one of North America's totemic artifacts, featuring canoes old and new, from birch bark to dugout to carbon fiber; the people who made them; and the adventures they shared. Fulcrum allowed University of Minnesota Press to make all the images in the book available for more detailed viewing and investigation, while preserving these digital objects and their associated metadata in a repository environment.</p>

          <p class="light"><em>Animal Acts</em> is a unique collection that explores the fields of animal studies and performance studies, highlighting the areas where these two fields overlap in surprising, provocative, and insightful ways. Eleven stories by solo performers are accompanied by commentary from scholars and artists. Fulcrum allowed the University of Michigan Press to publish video excerpts of several of the performances discussed in the book. </p>

          <p class="light">In this book, Mark Pedelty explores Cascadia's vibrant eco-musical community in order to understand how environmentalist music imagines, and perhaps even creates, a more sustainable conception of place. Fulcrum enabled Indiana University Press to make available several music videos and songs by well-known musician and environmental activist Dana Lyons.</p>

          <p class="light">Volume 2 of <em>Nothing but Love in God’s Water</em> by Robert Darden, continues the journey started in Volume 1 of chronicling the role music played in energizing and sustaining those most heavily involved in the civil rights movement. On Fulcrum, Penn State University Press was able to present an impressive array of images and interview transcripts collected by the author to support his scholarship. While the interview transcripts are not hosted on Fulcrum, the platform provides a durable landing page for each transcript, which then links to the externally hosted file. This gives the reader the ability to explore all of the materials in a much more cohesive manner.</p>

          <h3>Selma and the Liuzzo Murder Trials: The First Modern Civil Rights Convictions</h3>
          <span class="author">James P. Turner</span>
          <span class="pubdate">University of Michigan Press, 2018</span>
          <p class="light">In 1965 the drive for black voting rights in the south culminated in the epic Selma to Montgomery Freedom March. Within hours after that historic march, klan terror struck, claiming the life of one of the marchers, Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit mother of five. Turner offers an insider’s view of the three trials that took place over the following nine months -- which finally resulted in the conviction of the killers. On Fulcrum, one can explore multiple court documents, including court transcripts, exhibits, and memoranda to get a better, deeper understanding about this historic case and the times in which it was tried.</p>
