<p>Accessibility is a core design component of Fulcrum. We are dedicated to creating inclusive services and content for all readers and are constantly working to make Fulcrum and its content as accessible and usable as possible.</p>

<p>The Fulcrum platform aims to meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA">WCAG 2.0 AA Standards</a> by providing infrastructure and resources to support accessible books, image descriptions, transcripts for audio, captions for video, and alternative formats for digitized content. We are currently drafting a VPAT 2.1 document which we will make publicly available when completed.</p>

<p>Fulcrum provides hosting for a number of different publishers. Accessible content is the primary responsibility of each publisher and we are constantly working with them to support and improve the accessibility of their content. Our initiatives include partnering in the development of projects such as the <a href="https://describingvisualresources.org/">Describing Visual Resources Toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with tools</h2>
<p>Fulcrum should be compatible with recent versions of the following screen readers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JAWS</li>
  <li>NVDA</li>
  <li>VoiceOver</li>
</ul>

<p>The site should also be compatible with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic operating system screen magnifiers, such as ZoomText magnifier</li>
  <li>speech recognition software</li>
  <li>operating system speech packages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>From January to March 2018, in collaboration with <a href="https://usability.msu.edu/">Michigan State University Usability and Accessibility Research Consulting</a>, Fulcrum was tested by assistive technology users, identifying usability and accessibility issues we are actively working to fix. Some of these include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “More” pop-up windows when filtering media are problematic for keyboard-only or assistive technology users.</li>
  <li>While our e-reader is accessible, there are usability issues for assistive technology users.</li>
  <li>Some EPUB content from Fulcrum partners does not contain image descriptions or sufficient headings for assistive technology navigation.</li>
  <li>Some video content does not have captions; some audio content does not have transcripts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our accessibility development work is publicly available and can be tracked in our issue tracker for <a href="https://tools.lib.umich.edu/jira/projects/HELIO/issues/HELIO-1801?filter=allopenissues">Fulcrum</a> and our <a href="https://tools.lib.umich.edu/jira/projects/CSB/issues">E-Reader application</a>.</p>
