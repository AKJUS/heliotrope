  <p class="intro">Accessibility is a core value and design component of Fulcrum.  As part of the ongoing development of Fulcrum, we work to make the platform and its content inclusive, accessible, and usable for all readers.</p>
<p class="milli">Last updated: June 26, 2025</p>
<p>Fulcrum makes every reasonable effort to have its products and services available to all customers and users, especially those with disabilities, allocating significant time and resources towards ensuring Fulcrum users have equal access. We approach this with three guiding principles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Be responsive</strong> to requests for remediation or reported accessibility issues. We aim to respond to requests within 2 business days.</li>
    <li><strong>Be proactive</strong> by identifying and working on known platform issues and remediation of content for most likely to be used and essential functions of the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Be transparent</strong> as to what we are planning and doing to support accessibility requirements for the platform and its content.</li>
  </ol>
<p>You can follow our accessibility journey in the <a href="#roadmap">Accessibility Roadmap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conformance">Conformance Status and VPAT®s</h2>
<p>Fulcrum aims to meet the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.2" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 AA">WCAG 2 AA Standards</a> (currently WCAG 2.2 AA) in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing a platform with infrastructure that meets web accessibility guidelines and includes accessibility features. We report Fulcrum's compliance with WCAG 2.2 and Section 508 in a <a href="/docs/Fulcrum-VPAT2.5INT-MASTER-20250625.pdf">Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) Version 2.5 INT</a>. </li>
  <li>Creating and sharing resources that help publishers produce accessible content. We report content compliance <a href="#content">in collection specific VPAT®s</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fulcrum's conformance status is assessed through a combination of self-evaluation, user testing and feedback, and third-party evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility with Assistive Technology</h2>
<h3>Screen Reader Compatibility</h3>
<p>Fulcrum should be compatible with most major screen readers. It is optimized for use with NVDA in Firefox. New features are tested with NVDA in Firefox and VoiceOver in Safari. Fulcrum should be compatible with recent versions of the following screen readers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JAWS</li>
  <li>NVDA</li>
  <li>VoiceOver</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is also compatible with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>basic operating system screen magnifiers and contrast settings</li>
  <li>accessibility browser extensions, such as Read Aloud (text to speech), Zoom Text Only (magnifier), and High Contrast for Chrome</li>
  <li>speech recognition software</li>
  <li>operating system speech packages</li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>For readers using NVDA:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, alt-text image descriptions will be read when the embedded image is selected via the TAB key, but will not be read automatically via continuous reading. Alt-text image descriptions can be accessed by selecting the embedded image via keyboard controls or by following the link to the full image media page.</li>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, when searching inside the text of a book and following a search result, the matched term in the text is indicated on the page only through visual highlighting of the matched text, but the excerpts and chapter locations are accessible through screen reader technology.</li>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, text selection for highlighting or note taking does not work as expected.</li>
  <li>On <a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/sj139271b?locale=en">book title pages</a>, “Overview” is the default tab. To get to other tabs on that page, navigate to the “Overview” heading and press the right arrow key.</li>
  <li>On <a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/file_sets/x633f103b?locale=en">resources pages</a>, “Info” is the default tab. To get to others tabs, navigate to the “Info” heading and press the right arrow key.</li>
</ul>
<p>For readers using VoiceOver:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the focus in the Fulcrum Reader is on a piece of embedded content such as a video or image, the VoiceOver rotor only recognizes the media controls as links. To access the other links and menu buttons through the rotor, navigate away from the embedded piece of media first.</li>
</ul>

<p>For readers using Microsoft Edge Read Aloud:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, the visual display of text does not continue to scroll when Read Aloud reaches the bottom of the page.</li>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, it is not possible to adjust the emphasis styles in Read Aloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>For readers playing time-based media in resources or ebooks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of January 2022, the current version of AblePlayer on Fulcrum has a known issue where audio descriptions can auto-play when users activate descriptions to be read aloud by the player and navigate book pages. Turning off the read aloud function of the descriptions will resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>For readers using Dragon NaturallySpeaking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filter buttons and content on the <a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan">Search and Browse Books</a> page do not respond to voice command navigation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keyboard Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, all of the pages, and media content such as videos, audio, and images should be accessible via standard keyboard controls only (no use of a mouse required).</li>
  <li>Standard keyboard controls include:
    <ul>
      <li>TAB to move through links and buttons</li>
      <li>SHIFT+TAB to go back to a previous link or button</li>
      <li>ENTER to select</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Left and right arrow keys in the Fulcrum Reader provide shortcuts for easy page flipping or scrolling.</li>
  <li>Using scroll mode in the Fulcrum Reader, Page Up and Page Down and up and down arrow keys also allow for page scrolling.</li>
  <li>When reading PDFs in the Fulcrum Reader, pages can be rotated by either using the "Rotate Clockwise" button or pressing R on the keyboard. Both will rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise.</li>
  <li>The default video player shortcuts are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Alt + Control + p or spacebar = Play/Pause</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + s = Restart</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + r = Rewind</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + f = Forward</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + v or 1-9 = Volume</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + m = Mute/Unmute</li>
      <li>Alt + Control + c = Hide captions</li>
      <li>Escape = Close current dialog or popup menu</li>
    </ul>
    (The modifier keys can be changed through video keyboard settings.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Accessibility Features</h2>
<h3>Discovering Accessible Content</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All book pages on Fulcrum include an "Accessibility Claims" tab that includes accessibility information about the book if supplied by the publisher.</li>
  <li>If a book is not screen reader-friendly or has no supplied accessibility information, a button to request an accessible file for the book will be available. If the book is restricted access, you must be authenticated and authorized to the book or product for this button to appear.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fulcrum Reader</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For certain content, users can choose between page-by-page and scroll view in the Fulcrum Reader. To switch views, select the Preferences and Settings button and choose your preferred Display mode.</li>
  <li>Image descriptions are enabled for screen readers through alt-text attributes and linked extended descriptions when necessary (and when provided by publisher).</li>
  <li>While there is no built-in text-to-speech feature, screen readers and text-to-speech browser extensions such as Read Aloud for Chrome should work with the Fulcrum Reader as well as all of the book, publisher, and media pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Time-based Media</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AblePlayer video and audio player has the capability for captions, audio descriptions, and transcripts, though not all publishers may provide these features. The caption font, size, color, and location can be adjusted in the player settings. Captions and transcripts are available when provided by the publisher. As of January 2022, the current version of AblePlayer on Fulcrum has a known issue where audio descriptions can auto-play based on the time codes when users activate descriptions to be read aloud by the player. Turning off the read aloud function of the descriptions will resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For readers with low vision</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the Fulcrum Reader, a book's text can be zoomed up to 400% through the Preferences and Settings menu. Switching to scroll view is recommended when enlarging the text as this will shift the text from two columns to one.</li>
  <li>Operating system text zoom and font accessibility settings and browser extensions such as Zoom Text Only for Chrome should work with all of the other text on book, publisher, and media pages, as well as the menu bars in the Fulcrum Reader.</li>
  <li>The video player offers a full screen view and the image viewer offers a zoom function.</li>
  <li>The video player supports user control of caption settings, including toggle, position, font, size, text color, background, and opacity as well as user control of audio description (when captions and audio descriptions provided by publisher).</li>
  <li>Operating system contrast accessibility features and browser extensions such as High Contrast for Chrome should work with the Fulcrum Reader in addition to all other Fulcrum pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roadmap">Accessibility Roadmap</h2>
<p>Four areas of focus guide the Fulcrum Accessibility Roadmap:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make it easy to request accessible copies of books that do not meet accessibility requirements.</li>
    <li>Clearly communicate a book's accessibility conformance and features.</li>
    <li>Provide evidence of a plan to remediate books that do not meet accessibility requirements.</li>
    <li>Ensure the platform and its functionality are as accessible as possible.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Fulcrum provides hosting for a number of different publishers and we are a signatory of the <a href="https://www.accessiblebooksconsortium.org/documents/abc/docs/abc_charter.pdf" target="_blank">Accessible Book Consortium's Charter for Accessible Publishing</a>. Accessible content is the primary responsibility of each publisher yet to uphold our accessibility commitments to the ABC, we work with publishers to support and improve the accessibility of their content. Below you will find links to VPATs and accessibility features for large collections hosted on Fulcrum.</p>

<h3>ACLS Humanities E-Book</h3>
<p><a href="/docs/Fulcrum-HEB-VPAT2.4INT-20221014.pdf">ACLS HEB Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) Version 2.4 INT</a></p>
<p>In addition to the ACLS HEB VPAT®, ACLS HEB has made available an <a href="/docs/ConformanceandRemediationRoadmap-FulcrumACLSHEB-October2022.pdf">Accessibility Conformance and Remediation Roadmap (October 2022)</a> which describes timelines, development plans, and workarounds for issues identified in the VPAT®.</p>
<p>There are three types of book content within the ACLS Humanities E-Book (HEB). The type informs the accessibility of that content:</p>
<ul>
  <li>EPUBs created by reformatting print to digital and include page scans and uncorrected OCR text. When read in the Fulcrum Reader, the uncorrected OCR can be accessed by adjusting the Settings and Preferences to use the text renditions. These titles are available for chapter download only in PDF format. The PDF downloads do not include the uncorrected OCR.</li>
  <li>EPUBs created by reformatting print to digital and include reflowable, structured text. The content of these EPUBs are compatible with assistive technology. These titles are not available for download.</li>
  <li>Beginning in 2020, PDFs provided by publishers include OCR or born-digital text, bookmarks, but do not include structural markup and tagging. These titles are available for chapter download only in PDF format. PDF watermarks applied to each page of the downloaded file are read aloud by screenreaders and assistive technology.</li>
</ul> 
<p>ACLS HEB titles do not contain textual descriptions of images.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources for Creating Accessible Content</h2>
<p>There are several resources the Fulcrum team has developed to assist publishers in the creation of accessible content. These resources, as well as others on the web are detailed below.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://describingvisualresources.org/">Describing Visual Resources Toolkit</a>
    <p>Funded by the Kress Foundation, this resource was developed by the University of Michigan Press in partnership with leaders and experts in the fields of accessibility for libraries, museums, and archives. The resource aims to help authors, publishers, and others develop a best practice for describing images in the humanities and social sciences. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mlibrary/fulcrum-epub-spec">Fulcrum EPUB Specification</a>
    <p> In partnership with <a href="https://apexcovantage.com/">Apex Covantage</a> we developed and released a specification for the creation of highly accessible and Fulcrum compliant EPUBs. The specification was released under an Apache 2.0 License and can be re-used in-house by publisher's production teams, or supplied to vendors that assist in the creation of a publisher's ebook files.</p>
