<%# `as: :datetime` results in Simple Form outputting a `type="datetime-local"` control %>

<%# There is no setting for a HTML5 date control that allows a time zone to be set, that was the... %>
<%# `type="datetime-local"` control, which was removed from the HTML spec in favor of letting the programmer... %>
<%# deal with client time zone through browser locale stuff, or allowing the user to set it in their cookies. %>
<%# What this means here is that the closest we can get to a DateTime.to_s is the following ISO 8601 date+time: %>
<%# 2023-02-03T18:07:53 %>
<%# Granularity to the second is achieved with the `step: "1"` attribute. %>
<%# The `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')` is necessary to chop off the timezone information for the datepicker... %>
<%# widget, given the time would otherwise look like `2023-02-03T18:07:53+00:00` and fail to parse therein. %>
<%# For now just let the user know this is UTC time, we'd need to let them pick their own zone, or... %>
<%# detect it otherwise. And that seems OTT for this feature for our editors right now. %>
